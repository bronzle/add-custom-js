# What is this?
Really just a toy. I decided to take a jab at chrome extensions, and this, as something I would use occasionally seemed as good as anything else.

It adds custom JS and CSS to chrome, matching paths.


# Does it work.
Very good question Billy. This is alpha software (at best). It works, but has not been tested more more than "hello world". You could say its on GitHub for safe keeping.

# Contributors?
If there are any people interested in this, I am more than happy to take pull requests and update this. Like I said it was more an adventure than an end result, but it could have some really cool feates

# Possible Features
1. Instead of a popup, it could load an iframe colorbox (giving more room for the editor, features etc.)
2. Something else cool?
